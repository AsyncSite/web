# Review System Integration - Summary

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. Review API Service (`src/api/reviewService.ts`)
Complete TypeScript service with all review operations:
- Create, Read, Update, Delete reviews
- Like/Unlike functionality
- Statistics fetching
- Type-safe interfaces for all DTOs

### 2. Review Components Suite
```
components/review/
├── ReviewSection.tsx      # Main container component
├── ReviewList.tsx        # List with filtering & pagination
├── ReviewItem.tsx        # Individual review display
├── ReviewForm.tsx        # Create/Edit form
├── ReviewStatistics.tsx # Rating distribution charts
└── Review.css           # Complete styling
```

### 3. Integration Points

#### StudyDetailPageRenderer.tsx
- Added ReviewSection after all content sections
- Fetches study data to pass status to ReviewSection
- Only shows reviews for appropriate study states

#### ProfilePage.tsx
- Added "리뷰 작성" button for COMPLETED studies
- Different action text for leaders ("리뷰 관리")
- Styled action buttons with gradient background

## 🔧 How It Works

### User Flow
1. **Study Completion** → Study status changes to COMPLETED
2. **ProfilePage** → User sees "리뷰 작성" button on completed studies
3. **Click Button** → Navigates to study detail page review section
4. **Write Review** → Form with type, rating, title, content, tags
5. **Submit** → Review saved and displayed immediately
6. **Interact** → Like others' reviews, edit/delete own reviews

### Permission Model
- **Write**: Must be study member + study COMPLETED
- **Read**: Anyone can read reviews
- **Edit/Delete**: Only review author
- **Like**: Any authenticated user

### Review Types
- **OVERALL**: General study experience
- **CONTENT**: Study content quality
- **OPERATION**: Study management quality

Users can write one review per type (max 3 reviews per study).

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- Complete backend integration
- All CRUD operations
- Like system with optimistic updates
- Statistics calculation and display
- Filtering and pagination
- Permission checks

### 🟡 Partially Done
- ProfilePage still has UI complexity issues
- StudyManagementPage needs review management tab
- No email notifications for new reviews

### ❌ Not Implemented
- Review replies/comments
- Review reporting/moderation
- Review badges/achievements
- Export reviews to PDF

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
